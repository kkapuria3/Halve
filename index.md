# About Me

Armed with two masterâ€™s in bioinformatics and experience researching, tweaking, and implementing state-of-the-art computational methods, I am a chronic problem-solver and a lifelong learner. I unpack complicated problems in bioinformatics by approaching each with the flexible process and attention it deserves.

Take some snippet. Move it around, play with it, absorb & synthesize. Add structure, reinforcing the good parts and ripping out the bad bits. Patch up the holes that are left. Give it grace and elegance. Make it for an community, shaped so that they can understand it, the way you understand it.
