# About Me

I am a chronic problem-solver and a lifelong learner. I unpack complicated problems in bioinformatics by approaching each with the flexible process and attention it deserves.

This means that I work with others to ask questions, define approaches and execute solutions comprising:

  *  Strategy
  *  Workflow control
  *  Information architecture
  *  Portability 
  *  Interface design
  6.  Exceptional accuracy and precision
  7.  Phenomenal cloud parallelization

Iâ€™m on LinkedIn and GitHub and always love hearing about new projects at kapuriakaran@gmail.com
