# Bioinformatics Life

"The best bioinformaticians I know are problem solvers – they start the day not knowing something, and they enjoy finding out (themselves) how to do it. It’s a great skill to have, but for most, it’s not even a skill – it’s a passion, it’s a way of life, it’s a thrill. It’s what these people would do at the weekend (if their families and friends let them)."
