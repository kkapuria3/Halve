# About Me

I am a chronic problem-solver and a lifelong learner. I unpack complicated problems in bioinformatics by approaching each with the flexible process and attention it deserves.

This means that I work with others to ask questions, define approaches and execute solutions comprising:

1.  Strategy
2.  Workflow control
    ...Information architecture
    ...Portability 
    ...Interface design
    ...Exceptional accuracy and precision
    ...Phenomenal cloud parallelization

Iâ€™m on LinkedIn and GitHub and always love hearing about new projects at kapuriakaran@gmail.com
