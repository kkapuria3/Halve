## What Is Genetic Counseling?

The goal of genetic counseling is to help you learn more about the causes of genetic conditions and how they affect you. Genetic counselors can:

  * Review your family and medical histories.
  * Explain how genetic conditions are passed down through families.
  * Figure out if you or your family members are at risk for disease.
  * Find and give you information about genetic conditions.
  * Offer guidance to help you make informed choices or life plans.
  * Provide information about testing options and help you decide what is best for you and your family.
  * Help you find referrals to medical specialists, advocacy and support networks, and other resources.

## Why Might I See a Genetic Counselor?

  * You are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant and are concerned about the health of your baby.
  * Your baby had an abnormal result from newborn screening.
  * You, your child, or a family member has been diagnosed with a genetic condition.
  * You are concerned that you, your child, or a family member has a genetic or inherited condition and would like more information.
  * Your family has a history of developmental disability, birth defects, and/or mental retardation.
  * Your family has a history of mental illness.
  * Your family has a history of cancer.
